### Challenge
Advertisers like Nike, who spend significant sums on advertising platforms like Facebook and Google, face a major hurdle in measuring the true impact of their campaigns. Specifically, determining whether a specific targeted customer (e.g., Customer A) actually viewed and interacted with their ad is a complex task. This difficulty arises because ad networks are either reluctant or legally unable to share detailed customer data with advertisers due to privacy regulations. Despite this, ad networks want to provide advertisers with more insights to help them refine and optimize their marketing strategies.
